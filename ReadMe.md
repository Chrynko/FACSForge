ENCH670_SP25 Group Project:
Goals: Develop a machine learning model of tetrapyrrolic molecules for predicting optical properties.

Hydroporphyrins have very interesting and useful properties (absorbance and emission wavelength, lifetime) which help illuminate structure-property relationships. Generating structures from user-defined properties or predicting properties from user-defined structures would allow for faster prescreening throughput in dye design in applications such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), solar cells, biosensors, and photodynamic therapy (PDT).
